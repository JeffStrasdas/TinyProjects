Loads a maze from an image (as .bmp) and solves it, drawing the solution in a color gradient into the image.


This program first generates a network of nodes, then solves it using either the A*, Dijkstra or a 'simplify' algorithm.
The 'simplify' algortithm removes every dead end of the node network until only one path remains - the solution.
