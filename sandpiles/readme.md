A program that calculates the movement of sandpiles as described in "Sandpiles - Numberphile" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MtEUErz7Gg)

Due to the size of the calculated piles multiple ideas of optimizing the calcuations were implemented.
While the most severe deviations from the explicit calculation serves different results (due to an unnoticed error in the method), the computation time was reduced by several orders of magnitude.
